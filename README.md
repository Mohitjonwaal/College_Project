GDP vs. Crime Analysis Report

This document presents an analysis of the relationship between economic growth (GDP) and crime rates in five Indian states over the period 2011-2020. The study explores how socio-economic factors such as poverty, unemployment, and literacy correlate with total crime rates, using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. The report provides insights into the non-linear relationship between GDP and crime and offers recommendations for future research and policy interventions.

This analysis is part of a Bachelor's in Economics project at Shivaji College, University of Delhi.
